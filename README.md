Shipment On-Time Prediction and Analysis (WIP)
Currently developing an advanced data analysis and machine learning pipeline aimed at predicting the punctuality of shipments. 
This project leverages a comprehensive dataset containing various factors influencing delivery times to build a robust predictive model.

Key Objectives:

Data Extraction & Cleaning: Using Python libraries  Pandas and NumPy to load and preprocess the dataset ensuring data quality by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct thorough EDA using Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize data distributions, identify patterns, and detect outlier
